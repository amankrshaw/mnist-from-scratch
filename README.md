# Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST) â€“ **Built from Scratch using NumPy**

## Overview  
This project implements a **neural network from scratch using only NumPy** to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.  
No TensorFlow, no PyTorch â€“ everything coded manually to understand the core math behind deep learning.  

It also includes an **interactive Streamlit app** where you can **draw a digit** and get real-time predictions from the model.

## Features  
âœ” Fully connected neural network built from scratch (forward pass, backpropagation, gradient descent)  
âœ” Trained on the **MNIST dataset**  
âœ” Deployed with **Streamlit** for a user-friendly interface  
âœ” Supports drawing and prediction in real time

## Dataset  
The project uses the **MNIST dataset** (handwritten digits 0â€“9).  
Download it from **Kaggle** as a compressed archive:  

ðŸ”— [Download MNIST from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv)  

After downloading:  
- Extract the archive  
- Place `mnist_train.csv` and `mnist_test.csv` in the `data/` folder of the project

## âš™ Installation & Setup  

Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amankrshaw/mnist-from-scratch.git
cd mnist-from-scratch

Create a virtual environment and activate it:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

â–¶ Train the Model
Run the training script:
    python train.py
This will:
Load the MNIST dataset
Train the neural network from scratch
Save the trained model to model.pkl
Expected Accuracy:
âœ… ~97% on MNIST test set after training for multiple epochs

Run the Streamlit App
Launch the app to draw digits and predict:
streamlit run app.py
